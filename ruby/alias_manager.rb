# - take spy's real name
# - change all vowels (a,e,i,o,u) to next vowel in a,e,i,o,u
# - change all consonants to next consonant in alphabet
# - make program loop until user types 'quit'
# - save names into an "appropriate" data structure (prob hash)
# - iterate through data n print all when user quits.
# - define a method w/ parameters

# set vowels to variable
# ask spy's real name and make downcase
# make into array(split) and reverse words
# separate the words by .chars
# then use map! to affect each letter
# still inside map!,use if statement to change vowels to next
# use else to change all consonants to next
# make exception for 'z' to become 'b'
# gathering all names/data
# puts " 'fake name' is actually 'real name' "
