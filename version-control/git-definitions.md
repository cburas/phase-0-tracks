# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	a system that records changes made. This is useful for if you need to find a specific version.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	a movable pointer to a commit. It's best practices to not work on your master branch because
	you could break your codebase.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	snapshots of changes. A good commit message should be specific, brief and a description of the change.
* What is a merge conflict?
	This is when two contributors make changes to the same line of code in the same file and then try to
	commit at the same time. Git becomes confused and doesn't know which commit to accept.
