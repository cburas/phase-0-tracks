# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

version control is a management system that regulates work flow. from a baseline repository, individuals or subset teams can simultaneously work on aspects of a project without affecting the origin. Revisions are subject to approval and a history of them is kept. This allows for peer review, comparison, and refinement in as efficient a way as possible, allows for large numbers of people to work on a single project, and also allows code to be shared between collaborators easily.  

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

a branch is a parallel working copy of the main repository. one uses branches to build and test new features of the main code before integrating them into the main repository.  

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

a commit is the 3rd stage of an code edit, when the code is reintegrated to the branch, creating a new save point in version control. a good commit message is present tense and succinctly describes changes in the edited code

* What is a merge conflict?

when separate people or teams edit the same line of code differently, in separate branches. if both branches are merged, it creates a conflict as to which is the proper version and usually requires a manual merge to resolve.
