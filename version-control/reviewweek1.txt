1. Shell and Bash are the same thing as "Terminal" which is like... talking to your computer directly.

pwd: This is how you learn where you are in the terminal. What folder and what not.
ls: this lists stuff inside wherever you are
mv: this can rename a file or actually move it.
cd: go to/leave folder
touch: create new file
mkdir: make a new directory
rm: remove a file
help: get some help
find: can be used to locate certain files in folders
grep: locate specific lines in files.

2. Version control is how developers can look back on the changes made to their work. It's a system that records changes.

A commit is a snapshot of a change. Best practices for commit messages are to write concise and specific information detailing change made.

A branch is a pointer to a commit. A place to work within.

First you create the file within the branch you're in. Then you add it to be staged and ready for being committed. Then you actually commit the change with a message.

3. Git is for your computer. Github is this online sharing site. Like Google documents but a lot more complicated.

To create a repository, you type in the command line `git branch` followed by the name you would like. To clone you must find the URL of the repository you want to copy and paste that into command line after typing `git clone`. Finally, to update you commit your changes.

To fork a repository is basically the same process as cloning except you're attaching yourself to that parent repository.

A pull request is when you want to merge a branch's info with another. You can create it by requesting a pull request on Github. I have no idea how to merge one, except that you must have "write access" to accept the request.

I would believe the requests are preferred because sometimes a change might not be good or take something down a path the originator may not want. It's also just a great way to keep track of everything and who shared what.
