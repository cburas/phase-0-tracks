Google - W3Schools is a pretty good resource so that will probably come up so I'll read that.
Tutorials - There's probably a tutorial somewhere which will also come up... this sounds an awful lot like bootstrap though so I'm not sure a 'tutorial' is necessaryl. 
JQuery - just read through this apparent library. Get an idea of what I've got at my disposal. There's probably a cheat sheet somewhere which will tell me how to read and understand what I'm looking at so I'll bookmark that to my 'ClientLang' folder.

4:25 AND GO!
