Google - W3Schools is a pretty good resource so that will probably come up so I'll read that.
Tutorials - There's probably a tutorial somewhere which will also come up... this sounds an awful lot like bootstrap though so I'm not sure a 'tutorial' is necessaryl. 
JQuery - just read through this apparent library. Get an idea of what I've got at my disposal. There's probably a cheat sheet somewhere which will tell me how to read and understand what I'm looking at so I'll bookmark that to my 'ClientLang' folder.

4:25 AND GO!

9:24 AM the next day...

So Google is the all knowing, powerful one.
W3Schools had a 'tutorial' explaining Jquery it turned out so I read through that. I followed that with going to the Jquery learning center on their website. I think starting out with W3Schools was the right decision. I first started reading the site itself but I felt like there was still to much information. I needed something at first to give me bones and W3Schools did that.
