// I am so lost. I mean, where do you even begin??
// declare a variable.. we'll call it 'word' and have the actual word be 'javascript.'

var word = "javascript"

// I know I'm going to need it to print on the screen so I'm going to need, console and 'return'

function reverseString(string) {
	// I will probably need a loop to go through each character.. but how to move them??

}


// I know I will need to call the function
console.log(reverseString(word));
