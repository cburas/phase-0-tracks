	<h1> Oh bother... </h1>

	<p>
		Winnie the Pooh stuck his head in the last "Hunny" pot. <strong>Empty.</strong>

		"Oh, bother," Pooh stated. He was <em>obviously</em> going to have to find some more. But where?
		Well, there was
		<ul>
			<li>Rabbit</li>
			<li>Eeyore</li>
			<li>Owl</li>
			<li>Christopher Robin</li>
			<li>Tiger</li>
			<li>Piglet</li> and
			<li>Kanga and Roo</li>
		</ul>
		But who should he try first? Who was most likely to have some honey?

		"And be willing to share it," Pooh thought out loud. Although he was a bear of very little brain, he managed to create a list of who might have a small smackeral of honey and be willing to share it.
		<ol>
			<li>Christopher Robin</li>
			<li>Rabbit</li>
			<li>Piglet</li>
			<li>Owl</li> and
			<li>Kanga and Roo</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
